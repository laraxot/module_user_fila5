# PHPStan Roadmap - User Module

> **Date**: 2026-01-14
> **Status**: ✅ Fully Compliant (Level 10)
> **Errors**: 0

## Current Status
The **User** module is fully compliant with PHPStan Level 10. No errors were reported in the latest analysis.

## Documentation Note
> [!NOTE]
> This folder contains numerous legacy documentation files (`.md`).
> This file (`phpstan-roadmap.md`) is the **authoritative source** for PHPStan status and strategy.
> Older files relating to PHPStan fixes (e.g., `phpstan-fixes-*.md`) are preserved for historical context but should be considered archived.

## Maintenance Strategy
1.  **Strict Typing**: Ensure all new code uses strict types (`declare(strict_types=1);`).
2.  **Regular Checks**: Run PHPStan before every commit.
3.  **Documentation**: Keep PHPDocs up-to-date for complex types.

## Future Goals
- Clean up legacy documentation files to reduce clutter.
- Maintain 0 errors.
