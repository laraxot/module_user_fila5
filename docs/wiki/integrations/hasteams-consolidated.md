# Choice of currentTeam() Method in HasTeams Trait

## Analysis and Decision

In the `HasTeams.php` trait, there are two definitions of the `currentTeam()` method. After analysis, the following decision was made:

- **Chosen Method**: The second definition (lines 223-243) was retained as the active method. This version is more comprehensive, including logic for default team switching if no team is selected and handling edge cases like empty team lists. It also uses `TeamContract` for return type hinting, which aligns with the project's preference for abstraction via contracts/interfaces.

- **Commented Method**: The first definition was commented out due to its simplicity and direct use of the `Team` class instead of `TeamContract`. It lacked the additional logic for context switching and did not adhere to the project's SOLID principles of dependency inversion.

## Reasoning for Using TeamContract

Using `TeamContract` over `Team` provides several benefits:
- **Abstraction**: It allows for flexibility in implementation. Different classes can implement `TeamContract` without changing the code that depends on it.
- **Testability**: Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock implementations of the contract.
- **Future-Proofing**: If the underlying `Team` class changes, code using `TeamContract` remains unaffected as long as the contract is adhered to.
- **Project Consistency**: Aligns with the coding standards and architectural decisions outlined in the project documentation to prefer contracts/interfaces for dependency injection.

This decision ensures the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and consistent with the established architectural guidelines of the project.

## Implementation Notes

- The chosen `currentTeam()` method dynamically determines the team class using `XotData::make()->getTeamClass()`, further reinforcing the use of abstraction.
- Other methods in `HasTeams.php` have been updated to use `TeamContract` as the parameter type where applicable, maintaining consistency across the trait. This includes methods like `canAddTeamMember`, `canDeleteTeam`, `canLeaveTeam`, `canManageTeam`, `canRemoveTeamMember`, `canUpdateTeam`, `canUpdateTeamMember`, and `canViewTeam`.
- For the `ownedTeams()` method, while it returns a `HasMany` relation, the underlying model reference has been updated to use the full namespace `\Modules\User\Models\Team` to avoid direct imports, maintaining a level of abstraction.

## Note on Migration File Path Error

- An error was made in assuming the path for the migration file related to team ownership (`add_owner_id_to_teams_table.php`). Initially, the path was assumed to be in the main Laravel migrations directory (`/var/www/html/healthcare_app/laravel/database/migrations/`), whereas the correct path is within the User module's migrations directory (`/var/www/html/healthcare_app/laravel/Modules/User/database/migrations/`). This highlights the importance of verifying module-specific directory structures as per project guidelines to avoid such mistakes in the future.

# HasTeams Trait Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the `HasTeams` trait located in `Modules/User/app/Models/Traits/HasTeams.php`. The purpose is to review duplicate methods within the trait, determine which versions to retain, and justify the decisions based on functionality, usage, and project conventions.

## Duplicate Methods Analysis

### 1. `addTeamMember` and `addTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `addTeamMember($user, $role = null)`: Original method for adding a user to a team with an optional role.
  - `addTeamMemberDuplicate($user, $role = null)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `addTeamMember` as it follows the naming convention without the 'Duplicate' suffix, indicating it is the primary method intended for use. There are no differences in implementation or comments suggesting a unique purpose for the duplicate.
- **Reasoning**: Consistency in naming and likely the original method based on naming convention. No additional functionality or documentation exists in the duplicate to warrant its retention.

### 2. `hasTeamMember` and `hasTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `hasTeamMember($user)`: Original method to check if a user is on the team.
  - `hasTeamMemberDuplicate($user)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `hasTeamMember` for the same reasons as above. The naming convention suggests it is the intended primary method.
- **Reasoning**: Identical implementation with no additional comments or logic in the duplicate to justify keeping it. Consistency in naming across the trait is important for clarity.

### 3. `removeTeamMember` and `removeTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `removeTeamMember($user)`: Original method to remove a user from the team.
  - `removeTeamMemberDuplicate($user)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `removeTeamMember` following the pattern of choosing the non-duplicate named method.
- **Reasoning**: No differences in implementation or documentation. The 'Duplicate' suffix likely indicates it was added for testing or by mistake, with no unique purpose.

## Conclusion
After reviewing the duplicate methods in the `HasTeams` trait, the recommendation is to keep the methods without the 'Duplicate' suffix (`addTeamMember`, `hasTeamMember`, `removeTeamMember`) as they appear to be the primary implementations based on naming conventions. The duplicates do not provide any additional functionality or documentation to justify their existence. Future steps will involve removing these duplicate methods to streamline the codebase and maintain clarity.

**Next Steps**:
- Remove the duplicate methods from the `HasTeams` trait.
- Update any references in the codebase if necessary (though unlikely given the identical functionality).
- Document the changes in the project's changelog or relevant update logs.

# HasTeams Trait - Filosofia Laraxot e Strategia di Correzione Completa

## 🧠 LA FILOSOFIA LARAXOT: Perché `belongsToManyX` invece di `belongsToMany`

### La Religione del Codice Laraxot
La preferenza per `belongsToManyX` non è casuale, ma rappresenta una **filosofia architetturale profonda**:

#### 1. **AUTOMAZIONE INTELLIGENTE**
```php
// ❌ Laravel Standard - Manuale e ripetitivo
public function teams(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class, 'team_user')
                ->withTimestamps()
                ->withPivot(['role', 'permissions', 'status'])
                ->using(TeamUser::class);
}

// ✅ Laraxot Philosophy - Intelligente e automatico
public function teams(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToManyX(Team::class);
    // Automaticamente:
    // - Trova la tabella pivot (team_user)
    // - Trova il modello pivot (TeamUser)
    // - Include tutti i campi fillable del pivot
    // - Aggiunge timestamps
    // - Gestisce database cross-connection
}
```

#### 2. **CONVENZIONE OVER CONFIGURAZIONE**
- **Auto-discovery del modello pivot**: `TeamUser`, `DeviceUser`, `PermissionRole`
- **Auto-discovery della tabella**: basata sui nomi dei modelli
- **Auto-inclusion dei campi pivot**: tutti i `$fillable` del modello pivot
- **Cross-database support**: gestisce automaticamente database diversi

#### 3. **CONSISTENZA E MANUTENIBILITÀ**
- **Zero duplicazione**: non ripeti mai la configurazione pivot
- **Evoluzione automatica**: aggiungi un campo al pivot, funziona automaticamente
- **Errori ridotti**: meno codice manuale = meno errori

### La Politica Architettuale
```php
// FILOSOFIA: "Il framework deve lavorare per te, non tu per il framework"
```

## ✅ **CORREZIONI IMPLEMENTATE** - Gennaio 2025

### **🎯 STATUS: COMPLETATO**

Tutte le correzioni critiche sono state **implementate con successo** nel file `HasTeams.php`:

#### 1. **✅ Tipizzazione Rigorosa Completata**
```php
// PRIMA - DISASTRO
public function addTeamMember($user, $role = null)

// DOPO - PERFEZIONE ✅
public function addTeamMember(UserContract $user, ?Role $role = null): Model
```

#### 2. **✅ Logica Corretta Implementata**
```php
// PRIMA - DEMENZA
public function belongsToTeams(): bool
{
    return true; // Sempre true!
}

// DOPO - INTELLIGENZA ✅
public function belongsToTeams(): bool
{
    return $this->teams()->exists() || $this->ownedTeams()->exists();
}
```

#### 3. **✅ Null Safety Risolto**
```php
// PRIMA - PERICOLOSO
public function switchTeam(?TeamContract $team): bool
{
    if (! $this->belongsToTeam($team)) { // Null pointer!
        return false;
    }
    $this->current_team_id = (string) $team->id; // CRASH!
}

// DOPO - SICURO ✅
public function switchTeam(?TeamContract $team): bool
{
    if ($team === null) {
        $this->current_team_id = null;
        $this->save();
        return true;
    }
    
    if (! $this->belongsToTeam($team) && ! $this->ownsTeam($team)) {
        return false;
    }

    $this->current_team_id = (string) $team->id;
    $this->save();
    return true;
}
```

#### 4. **✅ Anti-pattern Rimossi**
```php
// PRIMA - ANTI-PATTERN
return $this->hasMany(app('team_invitation_model'), 'team_id');
return $this->hasMany(app('team_user_model'), 'team_id');

// DOPO - DEPENDENCY INJECTION ✅
return $this->hasMany(TeamInvitation::class, 'team_id');
return $this->hasMany(TeamUser::class, 'team_id');
```

#### 5. **✅ Proprietà Inesistente Corretta**
```php
// PRIMA - ERRORE
return $this->teamUsers->merge([$this->owner]); // owner non esiste!

// DOPO - LOGICA CORRETTA ✅
$currentTeamOwner = $this->currentTeam?->user ?? $this;
return $this->teamUsers->merge([$currentTeamOwner]);
```

#### 6. **✅ PHPDoc Completi Aggiunti**
```php
/**
 * Trait HasTeams - Gestione team secondo filosofia Laraxot.
 *
 * @property-read TeamContract|null $currentTeam
 * @property int|null $current_team_id
 * @property-read Collection<int, TeamContract> $teams
 * @property-read Collection<int, TeamContract> $ownedTeams
 */
trait HasTeams
{
    use RelationX; // ✅ Aggiunto per supportare belongsToManyX
}
```

#### 7. **✅ Validazione Rigorosa Implementata**
```php
public function addTeamMember(UserContract $user, ?Role $role = null): Model
{
    Assert::notNull($user, 'User cannot be null'); // ✅ Validazione
    
    $teamUser = $this->teamUsers()->create([
        'user_id' => $user->getKey(),
        'role_id' => $role?->getKey(), // ✅ Null-safe
    ]);

    $this->increment('total_members');
    return $teamUser;
}
```

#### 8. **✅ Logica Separata e Pulita**
```php
// PRIMA - LOGICA CONFUSA NEL GETTER
public function currentTeam(): BelongsTo
{
    // Side effects nel getter! 😱
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Altro codice con side effects...
}

// DOPO - SEPARAZIONE CHIARA ✅
public function currentTeam(): BelongsTo
{
    $xot = XotData::make();
    $teamClass = $xot->getTeamClass();
    return $this->belongsTo($teamClass, 'current_team_id');
}

public function ensureCurrentTeam(): void // ✅ Metodo separato
{
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Logica di inizializzazione separata
}
```

#### 9. **✅ Metodi Duplicati Eliminati**
```php
// PRIMA - DUPLICAZIONE
public function ownsTeam(TeamContract $team): bool { /* logica */ }
public function checkTeamOwnership(TeamContract $team): bool { /* stessa logica */ }

// DOPO - CLEAN ✅
public function ownsTeam(TeamContract $team): bool { /* unica implementazione */ }
// checkTeamOwnership() rimosso
```

- **Auto-discovery della tabella**: basata sui nomi dei modelli
- **Auto-inclusion dei campi pivot**: tutti i `$fillable` del modello pivot
- **Cross-database support**: gestisce automaticamente database diversi

#### 3. **CONSISTENZA E MANUTENIBILITÀ**
- **Zero duplicazione**: non ripeti mai la configurazione pivot
- **Evoluzione automatica**: aggiungi un campo al pivot, funziona automaticamente
- **Errori ridotti**: meno codice manuale = meno errori

### La Politica Architettuale

// FILOSOFIA: "Il framework deve lavorare per te, non tu per il framework"
```

## ✅ **CORREZIONI IMPLEMENTATE** - Gennaio 2025

{
    return $this->teams()->exists() || $this->ownedTeams()->exists();
}
```

#### 3. **✅ Null Safety Risolto**
```php
// PRIMA - PERICOLOSO
public function switchTeam(?TeamContract $team): bool
{
    if (! $this->belongsToTeam($team)) { // Null pointer!
        return false;
    }
    $this->current_team_id = (string) $team->id; // CRASH!
}

// DOPO - SICURO ✅
public function switchTeam(?TeamContract $team): bool
{
    if ($team === null) {
        $this->current_team_id = null;
        $this->save();
        return true;
    }
    
    if (! $this->belongsToTeam($team) && ! $this->ownsTeam($team)) {
        return false;
    }

    $this->current_team_id = (string) $team->id;
    $this->save();
    return true;
}
```

#### 4. **✅ Anti-pattern Rimossi**
```php
// PRIMA - ANTI-PATTERN
return $this->hasMany(app('team_invitation_model'), 'team_id');

$currentTeamOwner = $this->currentTeam?->user ?? $this;
return $this->teamUsers->merge([$currentTeamOwner]);
```

#### 6. **✅ PHPDoc Completi Aggiunti**
```php
/**
 * Trait HasTeams - Gestione team secondo filosofia Laraxot.
 *
 * @property-read TeamContract|null $currentTeam

 */
trait HasTeams
{
    use RelationX; // ✅ Aggiunto per supportare belongsToManyX
}
```

#### 7. **✅ Validazione Rigorosa Implementata**
```php
public function addTeamMember(UserContract $user, ?Role $role = null): Model
{
    Assert::notNull($user, 'User cannot be null'); // ✅ Validazione
    
    $teamUser = $this->teamUsers()->create([
        'user_id' => $user->getKey(),
        'role_id' => $role?->getKey(), // ✅ Null-safe
    ]);

    $this->increment('total_members');
    return $teamUser;
}
```

#### 8. **✅ Logica Separata e Pulita**
```php
// PRIMA - LOGICA CONFUSA NEL GETTER

{
    // Side effects nel getter! 😱
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Altro codice con side effects...
}

// DOPO - SEPARAZIONE CHIARA ✅
public function currentTeam(): BelongsTo
{
    $xot = XotData::make();
    $teamClass = $xot->getTeamClass();
    return $this->belongsTo($teamClass, 'current_team_id');
}

{
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Logica di inizializzazione separata
}
```

#### 9. **✅ Metodi Duplicati Eliminati**
```php
// PRIMA - DUPLICAZIONE
public function ownsTeam(TeamContract $team): bool { /* logica */ }

# HasTeams Trait Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the `HasTeams` trait located in `Modules/User/app/Models/Traits/HasTeams.php`. The purpose is to review duplicate methods within the trait, determine which versions to retain, and justify the decisions based on functionality, usage, and project conventions.

## Duplicate Methods Analysis

### 1. `addTeamMember` and `addTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `addTeamMember($user, $role = null)`: Original method for adding a user to a team with an optional role.
  - `addTeamMemberDuplicate($user, $role = null)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `addTeamMember` as it follows the naming convention without the 'Duplicate' suffix, indicating it is the primary method intended for use. There are no differences in implementation or comments suggesting a unique purpose for the duplicate.
- **Reasoning**: Consistency in naming and likely the original method based on naming convention. No additional functionality or documentation exists in the duplicate to warrant its retention.

### 2. `hasTeamMember` and `hasTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `hasTeamMember($user)`: Original method to check if a user is on the team.
  - `hasTeamMemberDuplicate($user)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `hasTeamMember` for the same reasons as above. The naming convention suggests it is the intended primary method.
- **Reasoning**: Identical implementation with no additional comments or logic in the duplicate to justify keeping it. Consistency in naming across the trait is important for clarity.

### 3. `removeTeamMember` and `removeTeamMemberDuplicate`
- **Method Signature Comparison**:
  - `removeTeamMember($user)`: Original method to remove a user from the team.
  - `removeTeamMemberDuplicate($user)`: Duplicate method with identical functionality.
- **Recommendation**: Retain `removeTeamMember` following the pattern of choosing the non-duplicate named method.
- **Reasoning**: No differences in implementation or documentation. The 'Duplicate' suffix likely indicates it was added for testing or by mistake, with no unique purpose.

## Conclusion
After reviewing the duplicate methods in the `HasTeams` trait, the recommendation is to keep the methods without the 'Duplicate' suffix (`addTeamMember`, `hasTeamMember`, `removeTeamMember`) as they appear to be the primary implementations based on naming conventions. The duplicates do not provide any additional functionality or documentation to justify their existence. Future steps will involve removing these duplicate methods to streamline the codebase and maintain clarity.

**Next Steps**:
- Remove the duplicate methods from the `HasTeams` trait.
- Update any references in the codebase if necessary (though unlikely given the identical functionality).
- Document the changes in the project's changelog or relevant update logs.

# Analisi metodi duplicati in HasTeams (trait)

## Introduzione
Nel trait `HasTeams` sono presenti diversi metodi con lo stesso nome ma implementazioni differenti. Questo documento elenca i metodi in ordine alfabetico, individua i duplicati e fornisce criteri oggettivi per decidere quale versione mantenere in fase di refactor.

## Elenco metodi (in ordine alfabetico)

- allTeams()
- belongsToTeam()
- belongsToTeams()
- canAddTeamMember()
- canCreateTeam()
- canDeleteTeam()
- canLeaveTeam()
- canManageTeam()
- canRemoveTeamMember()
- canUpdateTeam()
- canUpdateTeamMember()
- canViewTeam()
- currentTeam()
- demoteFromAdmin()
- getTeamAdmins()
- getTeamMembers()
- hasTeamPermission()
- hasTeamRole()
- hasTeams()
- inviteToTeam()
- isCurrentTeam()
- isOwnerOrMember()
- ownedTeams()
- personalTeam()
- promoteToAdmin()
- removeFromTeam()
- switchTeam()
- teamPermissions()
- teamRole()
- teams()

## Metodi duplicati rilevati

- allTeams()
- belongsToTeam()
- currentTeam()
- hasTeamPermission()
- hasTeamRole()
- ownedTeams()
- personalTeam()
- switchTeam()
- teamPermissions()
- teamRole()

## Criteri per la scelta della versione da mantenere

1. **Tipizzazione e parametri**: preferire la versione con type hinting più rigoroso e parametri nullable solo se necessario.
2. **Compatibilità con interfacce/contratti**: mantenere la versione che rispetta i contratti definiti nei moduli (es. TeamContract, UserContract).
3. **Aderenza alle convenzioni di progetto**: preferire la versione che segue le convenzioni di naming, return type, e uso dei trait.
4. **Presenza di controlli e validazioni**: mantenere la versione che effettua più controlli (es. null, instanceof, assert).
5. **Uso di dipendenze e helper**: preferire la versione che utilizza helper centralizzati (es. XotData) e riduce la duplicazione di logica.
6. **Chiarezza e manutenibilità**: mantenere la versione più leggibile, documentata e facilmente estendibile.
7. **Compatibilità con Eloquent/Laravel**: preferire la versione che sfrutta al meglio le relazioni Eloquent e le feature Laravel.

## Esempio di confronto (belongsToTeam)
- Versione 1: usa teams()->get()->first(...)
- Versione 2: usa $this->teams->contains(...)
- **Criterio**: preferire la versione che funziona sia con relazioni caricate che lazy, e che gestisce meglio i casi edge/null.

## Checklist per refactor futuro
- [ ] Individuare tutti i duplicati e confrontare le firme
- [ ] Applicare i criteri sopra per ogni coppia
- [ ] Mantenere solo la versione migliore e rimuovere l'altra
- [ ] Aggiornare i test e la documentazione
- [ ] Verificare la compatibilità con i moduli che usano il trait

> Questo documento va aggiornato ogni volta che si interviene sul trait HasTeams o si modificano le convenzioni di progetto relative ai trait e alle relazioni tra modelli. 

## Nota architetturale: TeamContract vs Team

Quando si implementano trait come HasTeams, è fondamentale tipizzare e accettare sempre `TeamContract` invece di `Team` nei metodi e nelle relazioni. Questo garantisce:
- compatibilità con implementazioni custom di team
- facilità di test tramite mock/stub
- manutenibilità e flessibilità futura

Per la motivazione dettagliata, vedi la sezione dedicata in [Team.md](./Models/Team.md#motivazione-preferire-teamcontract-a-team-nei-trait-e-nei-metodi).

## hasteams_currentteam_method_choice

*Consolidated from: `hasteams_currentteam_method_choice.md`*


## Analysis and Decision

In the `HasTeams.php` trait, there are two definitions of the `currentTeam()` method. After analysis, the following decision was made:

- **Chosen Method**: The second definition (lines 223-243) was retained as the active method. This version is more comprehensive, including logic for default team switching if no team is selected and handling edge cases like empty team lists. It also uses `TeamContract` for return type hinting, which aligns with the project's preference for abstraction via contracts/interfaces.

- **Commented Method**: The first definition was commented out due to its simplicity and direct use of the `Team` class instead of `TeamContract`. It lacked the additional logic for context switching and did not adhere to the project's SOLID principles of dependency inversion.

## Reasoning for Using TeamContract

Using `TeamContract` over `Team` provides several benefits:
- **Abstraction**: It allows for flexibility in implementation. Different classes can implement `TeamContract` without changing the code that depends on it.
- **Testability**: Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock implementations of the contract.
- **Future-Proofing**: If the underlying `Team` class changes, code using `TeamContract` remains unaffected as long as the contract is adhered to.
- **Project Consistency**: Aligns with the coding standards and architectural decisions outlined in the project documentation to prefer contracts/interfaces for dependency injection.

This decision ensures the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, and consistent with the established architectural guidelines of the project.

## Implementation Notes

- The chosen `currentTeam()` method dynamically determines the team class using `XotData::make()->getTeamClass()`, further reinforcing the use of abstraction.
- Other methods in `HasTeams.php` have been updated to use `TeamContract` as the parameter type where applicable, maintaining consistency across the trait. This includes methods like `canAddTeamMember`, `canDeleteTeam`, `canLeaveTeam`, `canManageTeam`, `canRemoveTeamMember`, `canUpdateTeam`, `canUpdateTeamMember`, and `canViewTeam`.
- For the `ownedTeams()` method, while it returns a `HasMany` relation, the underlying model reference has been updated to use the full namespace `\Modules\User\Models\Team` to avoid direct imports, maintaining a level of abstraction.

## Note on Migration File Path Error

- An error was made in assuming the path for the migration file related to team ownership (`add_owner_id_to_teams_table.php`). Initially, the path was assumed to be in the main Laravel migrations directory (`/var/www/html/saluteora/laravel/database/migrations/`), whereas the correct path is within the User module's migrations directory (`/var/www/html/saluteora/laravel/Modules/User/database/migrations/`). This highlights the importance of verifying module-specific directory structures as per project guidelines to avoid such mistakes in the future.

## 🧠 LA FILOSOFIA LARAXOT: Perché `belongsToManyX` invece di `belongsToMany`

### La Religione del Codice Laraxot
La preferenza per `belongsToManyX` non è casuale, ma rappresenta una **filosofia architetturale profonda**:

#### 1. **AUTOMAZIONE INTELLIGENTE**
```php
// ❌ Laravel Standard - Manuale e ripetitivo
public function teams(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class, 'team_user')
                ->withTimestamps()
                ->withPivot(['role', 'permissions', 'status'])
                ->using(TeamUser::class);
}

// ✅ Laraxot Philosophy - Intelligente e automatico
public function teams(): BelongsToMany
{
    return $this->belongsToManyX(Team::class);
    // Automaticamente:
    // - Trova la tabella pivot (team_user)
    // - Trova il modello pivot (TeamUser)
    // - Include tutti i campi fillable del pivot
    // - Aggiunge timestamps
    // - Gestisce database cross-connection
}
```

#### 2. **CONVENZIONE OVER CONFIGURAZIONE**
- **Auto-discovery del modello pivot**: `TeamUser`, `DeviceUser`, `PermissionRole`
- **Auto-discovery della tabella**: basata sui nomi dei modelli
- **Auto-inclusion dei campi pivot**: tutti i `$fillable` del modello pivot
- **Cross-database support**: gestisce automaticamente database diversi

#### 3. **CONSISTENZA E MANUTENIBILITÀ**
- **Zero duplicazione**: non ripeti mai la configurazione pivot
- **Evoluzione automatica**: aggiungi un campo al pivot, funziona automaticamente
- **Errori ridotti**: meno codice manuale = meno errori

### La Politica Architettuale

// FILOSOFIA: "Il framework deve lavorare per te, non tu per il framework"
```

        'role_id' => $role?->getKey(), // ✅ Null-safe
    ]);

    $this->increment('total_members');
    return $teamUser;

#### 8. **✅ Logica Separata e Pulita**
```php
// PRIMA - LOGICA CONFUSA NEL GETTER
public function currentTeam(): BelongsTo
{
    // Side effects nel getter! 😱
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Altro codice con side effects...
}

// DOPO - SEPARAZIONE CHIARA ✅
public function currentTeam(): BelongsTo
{
    $xot = XotData::make();
    $teamClass = $xot->getTeamClass();
    return $this->belongsTo($teamClass, 'current_team_id');
}

public function ensureCurrentTeam(): void // ✅ Metodo separato
{
    if ($this->current_team_id === null && $this->id) {
        $this->switchTeam($this->personalTeam());
    }
    // Logica di inizializzazione separata
}
```

#### 9. **✅ Metodi Duplicati Eliminati**
```php
// PRIMA - DUPLICAZIONE
public function ownsTeam(TeamContract $team): bool { /* logica */ }
public function checkTeamOwnership(TeamContract $team): bool { /* stessa logica */ }

// DOPO - CLEAN ✅
public function ownsTeam(TeamContract $team): bool { /* unica implementazione */ }
// checkTeamOwnership() rimosso
```
