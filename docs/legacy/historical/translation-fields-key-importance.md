# Understanding Translation Structure in Laraxot Framework

## [DATE] - Translation Key Analysis

### Context
During analysis of translation files in the User module, specifically `/laravel/Modules/User/lang/fr/authentication_log.php`, it was observed that the 'fields' key is present and functioning correctly.

### Philosophy and Logic
The 'fields' key in translation files is essential for the Filament translation system. It follows the pattern `modulo::risorsa.fields.campo.label` as documented in the Laraxot architecture. This structure allows automatic translation of form fields, table columns, and other UI elements without requiring explicit `->label()` calls in the component definitions.

### Business Logic
- The 'fields' key contains translations for all model fields
- Each field has sub-keys like 'label', 'placeholder', 'helper_text'
- This enables centralized translation management
- Follows DRY principle by avoiding duplication of field labels in code

### Conclusion
The 'fields' key is not only important but essential for the proper functioning of the translation and UI system in Laraxot. It must be preserved and maintained in all translation files.

### Rule
NEVER remove the 'fields' key from translation files as it is critical for the Filament translation system.
